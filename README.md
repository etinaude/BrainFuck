# Brainfuck-practice
I am learning to program in [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

brain fuck consists of 8 characters.<br>
  \>   move the data pointer right<br>
  \<   move the data pointer left<br>
  \+   increment the current cell<br>
  \-   decrement the current cell<br>
  \,   get 1 byte of user input<br>
  \.   output the current cell value in character form<br>
  \[   if the current cell is 0 jump forwards to the instruction after the next ]<br>
  ]   if the current cell is non-0 jump backwards to the instrucytion after the previous \[<br>

so it's a fairly LLL which is turing complete

I plan to learn a bunch of new langaues this is just the start. 
so far it cal get a user input for thier name and output "HELLO: " followed by their name this is a very basic start to brainfuck and I will hopefully program a cool thing in it some time soon.

I have also made a brainfuck interpreter in [google sheets](http://bit.ly/2X1q8h6), this is to be used as a learning tool and thus is slow so the user is able to see what happens as the programme steps through the code.
